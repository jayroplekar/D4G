# Gemini Session Summary

This document summarizes the key changes and debugging steps performed during this session.

## 1. Debugging Empty Persona Graph in `email_campaign_analysis.py`

**Problem:** The "Email Campaign Performance by Donor Personas" graph in the PDF output was empty. This was traced to a failure in merging email campaign data with persona data.

**Initial Hypothesis & Debugging Steps:**
*   **Incorrect CSV output from `persona_analysis.py`:** Initially, it was thought that `d4g_value_output.csv` (containing persona data) was being saved with an extra index column, causing merge issues.
    *   **Action:** Modified `persona_analysis.py` to save `d4g_value_output.csv` without the index (`index=False`).
    *   **Result:** This introduced a `SyntaxError` and then a `NameError` (`df_stats` not defined), which were subsequently fixed. However, the persona graph remained empty.
*   **Incorrect command-line argument parsing in `combined.py`:** The analysis output was going to `--input_dir` instead of `TestOutput`.
    *   **Action:** Modified `combined.py` to use `argparse` for robust command-line argument parsing, correctly handling `--input_dir` and `--output_dir` flags.
    *   **Result:** Output directory issue resolved, but persona graph still empty.
*   **Mismatch in merge keys (`CONTACT` vs `AccountId`):** Suspected that the `CONTACT` column in the email data and `AccountId` in the persona data had different formats, preventing successful merging.
    *   **Action:** Added extensive debug logging to `email_campaign_analysis.py` to inspect `df` (email data) and `df_personas` (persona data) dataframes, including their `head()` and `info()`.
    *   **Result:** Logs confirmed that `df['CONTACT']` contained `A00XX` style IDs, while `df_personas['AccountId']` contained long alphanumeric IDs.
*   **Attempted linking via `d4g_account.csv`:** Hypothesized that `d4g_account.csv` could bridge the gap, as it contains both `AccountNumber` (thought to match `A00XX`) and `Id` (long alphanumeric).
    *   **Action:** Modified `email_campaign_analysis.py` to load `d4g_account.csv` and merge `df` with `df_account` on `CONTACT` and `AccountNumber`, then with `df_personas` on `Id` and `AccountId`.
    *   **Result:** This did not resolve the issue, as `AccountNumber` in `d4g_account.csv` did not match the `A00XX` format.
*   **Revised linking via `UNIQUE_PERSON_ID`:** Identified `UNIQUE_PERSON_ID` in `contact_extract.csv` as a potential link to `Id` in `d4g_account.csv`.
    *   **Action:** Modified `email_campaign_analysis.py` to merge `df` with `df_account` on `UNIQUE_PERSON_ID` and `Id`, then with `df_personas` on `Id` and `AccountId`.
    *   **Result:** Still no resolution, indicating a data type mismatch or no matching values.
*   **Explicit Type Conversion for Merge Keys:** Realized that even if values were conceptually matching, data type differences could cause merge failures.
    *   **Action:** Explicitly converted `df['UNIQUE_PERSON_ID']` and `df_account['Id']` to string type before merging.
    *   **Result:** This led to an `IndentationError`, which was subsequently fixed.

**Current Status of Persona Graph:** The persona graph is still empty, indicating the data linking issue persists despite multiple attempts.

## 2. Updating X-axis Labels in `persona_analysis.py`

**Problem:** The x-axis labels on the histograms on the first page of the PDF were generic ("Value").

**Solution:**
*   **Action:** Modified `persona_analysis.py` to dynamically set the x-axis labels for 'Total Donation Amount Distribution', 'Donation Frequency Distribution', and 'Donor Engagement Timeline' to 'Total Amount', 'Number of Donations', and 'Dormancy Years' respectively.
*   **Result:** The x-axis labels are now correctly updated in the generated PDF.

## 3. Persisting Output Directory Preference

**Problem:** The analysis output was not consistently going to the `TestOutput` directory.

**Solution:**
*   **Action:** Modified `combined.py` to use `argparse` for command-line argument parsing, setting the default `output_dir` to `TestOutput`.
*   **Action:** Used the `save_memory` tool to persist the preference for `TestOutput` as the default output directory for future sessions.
*   **Result:** The output is now correctly directed to `TestOutput`, and the preference is saved.
